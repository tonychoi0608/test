# Project Blueprint: Status Window

## Overview

This project is a simple web application that displays a "status window," similar to what you might find in a role-playing game (RPG). It will show stats like level, HP, MP, and experience points.

## Design and Features

### Visual Design

*   **Theme:** Dark theme with a retro, pixelated aesthetic.
*   **Font:** A pixelated font will be used to enhance the retro game feel.
*   **Layout:** A single, centered status window.
*   **Colors:** A palette of dark grays, blues, and bright colors for stats and bars.
*   **Effects:** Gradients and shadows to give the UI depth.

### Features

*   **Stats Display:** Shows Level, HP, MP, and EXP.
*   **Interactive Elements:** Buttons to simulate gaining experience or resting.

## Current Plan

1.  **HTML Structure (`index.html`):**
    *   Set up the basic HTML structure for the status window.
    *   Add elements for the title, stats, and buttons.
2.  **Styling (`style.css`):**
    *   Apply the dark theme and pixelated font.
    *   Style the status window container.
    *   Style the stat bars (HP, MP, EXP).
    *   Add hover effects to buttons.
3.  **JavaScript Logic (`main.js`):**
    *   (Placeholder) Add basic interactivity to the buttons.
